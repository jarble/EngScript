EngScript is an intuitive and extensible English-like programming language.

You can write programs in plain English and automatically compile them to Python code.

For a working demo of EngScript, see [main.py](main.py).

Some useful code samples:
----
	#Create a string from a file
	print{create a string from the file called "README.txt"}
	
	#Save a string as a file
	print{save the string "Woohoo!" to a file called "ExampleText.txt"}
	
	#Get the first few letters of a string
	print{the first 3 letters of "EngScript"}
	#This prints "Eng".
